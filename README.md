This proposal calls for decisive action and collaboration between government, industry, and the community. By investing in a world-class public and active transport system, we can unlock Melbourne's full potential, creating a city that is truly liveable, sustainable, and accessible for all.

## 2. Current Situation Analysis

Melbourne faces a critical juncture in its development. While renowned for its liveability, the city's transport system is under increasing strain, threatening its future prosperity and sustainability. This section analyses the key challenges facing Melbourne's public and active transport infrastructure, providing a clear rationale for the transformative solutions proposed in this document.

### 2.1 Population Growth and Travel Patterns

Melbourne is experiencing rapid population growth, projected to become Australia's largest city by 2031-32 and reach around 8 million residents by 2050. This growth is particularly pronounced in the outer suburbs, especially in the west, where areas like Melton, Wyndham, and Brimbank are witnessing significant expansion driven by affordable housing and new developments. This trend is expected to continue, placing increasing pressure on the existing transport network.

This population growth is not evenly distributed, leading to diverse travel patterns. While inner-city residents often have good access to public transport and amenities within walking or cycling distance, those in the outer suburbs face longer commutes and greater reliance on private vehicles. This disparity contributes to increased congestion, particularly during peak hours, and highlights the need for a more equitable and accessible transport system.

### 2.2 Public Transport Usage

Despite having a relatively comprehensive public transport system, Melbourne's car dependency remains high. Public transport usage is generally concentrated in inner suburbs with good access to train lines and tram routes. In contrast, the outer suburbs, particularly in the west, experience significantly lower usage rates. This is attributed to several factors:

* **Lower service frequency:** Train lines and bus routes in the outer suburbs often operate with lower frequencies compared to inner-city services, leading to longer wait times and reduced convenience.
* **Longer travel times:**  Increased distances to the CBD and other key destinations result in longer commute times, making public transport less appealing for those in the outer suburbs.
* **Limited connectivity:**  Many areas in the outer suburbs lack access to multiple modes of public transport, requiring transfers and increasing journey complexity. This is particularly evident in the west, where the absence of a tram network further limits travel options.

### 2.3 Car Dependency

Car ownership rates are high in Melbourne, with many households owning multiple vehicles. This is particularly pronounced in the outer western suburbs, where car dependency is driven by a combination of factors:

* **Lower density development:** Suburban sprawl and larger distances between homes, shops, and services make car ownership seem more necessary for daily life.
* **Limited public transport options:**  The lack of frequent, reliable, and well-connected public transport in the outer suburbs reinforces car dependency.
* **Affordability:** While housing may be more affordable in outer suburbs, the "cost of car ownership" can become a significant burden for low-income households, leading to "forced car ownership."

This high car dependency contributes to traffic congestion, increases greenhouse gas emissions, and limits access to opportunities for those who cannot afford or are unable to drive.

### 2.4 Active Transport Challenges

While Melbourne has made some progress in promoting active transport, significant challenges remain. Cycling infrastructure is often inadequate, with a lack of separated bike paths and secure parking, discouraging many from cycling, particularly for transport.  Pedestrian infrastructure also needs improvement, especially in suburban areas where narrow footpaths, inadequate crossings, and high-speed traffic create a hostile environment for those on foot.

These challenges contribute to low levels of active transport, limiting its potential to improve public health, reduce congestion, and enhance the liveability of Melbourne's suburbs.

### 2.5 Conclusion

Melbourne's current transport system is not equipped to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and evolving city.  The over-reliance on private vehicles, particularly in the outer suburbs, is unsustainable and inequitable. Addressing these challenges requires a bold vision and a commitment to transforming Melbourne's public and active transport infrastructure. The following sections of this proposal will outline the solutions necessary to achieve this transformation.

## 3. Proposed Solutions
